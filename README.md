# Traffic Routing Optimizer (Graph Algorithms CLI)

This is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) based project** implementing classical **graph algorithms** to solve real-world routing and optimization problems.  
The program provides an interactive menu to choose between four optimization problems.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Signal Propagation Time (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**  
   - Problem: Find the minimum time for a signal to reach all nodes in a network.

2. **Least-Cost Route with Maximum Stops (Modified Dijkstra‚Äôs / BFS)**  
   - Problem: Find the cheapest price for a flight with at most `k` stops.

3. **Minimum Effort Terrain Traversal (Dijkstra on a Grid)**  
   - Problem: Traverse a 2D grid with minimum "effort" considering height differences.

4. **Most Reliable Route (Dijkstra with Probabilities)**  
   - Problem: Maximize the probability of reaching a destination.
